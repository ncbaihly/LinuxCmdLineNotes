# Chapter 3 Notes

## Command summary

* `ls` - list directory contents
* `file` - determine file type
* `less` - view file contents

## `ls`


With `ls` we can list the file contents of the current working directory with no arguments or we can specify a path to list.
We can even specify multiple directories like so `ls ~ /usr`.

Most commands in general will look something like this `command -options *arguments*`. Although commands have default behavior without options or arguments,
depending on which are given we can specify more precisely what we want. Commands often also allow for short options to be concatenated directly like `ls -lt`.

Some commands like those from GNU allow for long options with a double dash, for example `ls --reverse` to change the order of the sort.
