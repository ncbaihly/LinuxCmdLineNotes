# Chapter 2 Notes

* `pwd` - print path with name of current working directory
* `cd` - change directory
* `ls` - list directory contents

Linux organizes its files in a hierarchical directory structure. So there is a tree like pattern of directories or folders.

The top directory or folder in the file system is called the root directory. Windows has a separate tree for each storage device, Linux always has a single tree.
Storage devices are mounted at different points of the tree according to the person using the system.

Each user account has its own home directory which is usually the only place(and below) where a normal user could write.

`ls` can be used to list the contents of the current folder with no argument or you can specify a path for it to list the contents of.

### cd arguments

* `cd -` - change working directory to previous working directory
